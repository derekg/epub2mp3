# Screenshots

To add the main UI screenshot:

1. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
2. Optionally load an EPUB to show the full interface with chapters
3. Take a screenshot (Cmd+Shift+4, then Space, then click the browser window on macOS)
4. Save as `inkvoice-ui.png` in this folder

For best results, capture the browser window showing:
- The Inkvoice header and description
- The upload area or loaded book with chapters
- The voice/format options
